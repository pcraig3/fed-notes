2. Ordered list item
3. Ordered list item

#### Unordered Lists

#### Headers

Setext-style:

# This is H1

## This is H2

atx-style:

# This is H1

## This is H2

### This is H3

#### This is H4

##### This is H5

###### This is H6

### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~

#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard Markdown’s regular code
blocks, except that they’re not indented and instead rely on
a start and end fence lines to delimit the code block.
```

#### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

Specify alignement for each column by adding colons to separator lines:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| :----------- | :-----------: | -----------: |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
